# deep_rl_ale
This repo contains an implementation of [this paper](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf) in TensorFlow.  The code runs and learns, but I'm still testing it, and changing it.  It masters Pong, and does well on breakout, but doesn't score quite as high as the paper yet.
