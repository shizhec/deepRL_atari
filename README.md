# deep_rl_ale
This repo contains an implementation of [this paper](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf) in TensorFlow.  The code runs and learns, but I'm still testing it.  It's very messy/hacky right now, but I'll be cleaning it up and making it nice soon.

3/20/16-4/2/16:  I'm going to be pushing some commits during these dates without being able to test them, so the project WILL NOT RUN during this time.
